Probability
P(H) = Number of Possibility of meeting my condition / Number of equally likely events
In case of fair coin, number of equally likely events are Head, Tail
For getting head, only Head is meeting my condition which is one
So Total probability of getting head is P(H) = 1/2

Probability of Getting Head And Tail = 0/2 = 0

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A And B)

Compound probability of independent events
Probability of getting TWO HEADS in two spin of coins = Probability of getting head in first spin * Probability of getting head in second spin
Probability of getting TWO HEADS in two spin of coins = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4

Getting at least one head is equal to Not getting all tails
 For 3 flips of coin - 7/8 (At least one head)
 Formula = 1-P(TTT) = 1- 1/8 = 7/8
 
For counting probability of unfair coin, Frequency is used: like 60% chance of getting head and 40% chance of getting tail. SO in this case we will consider 3/5 for head and 2/5 for tail. 

Binomial Coefficient: n!/(k!(n-k)!)

Formula for K exactly heads out of n spins = (n!/(k!(n-k)!))/ 2^n

3 exactly heads out of 5 spins result using above formula
120
---- = 10/32
6*2

Base Theorem P(b |a) = P(a|b)p(b) / p(a)
