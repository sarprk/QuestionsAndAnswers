Promise has 3 states: Pending, Fulfilled, rejected

Inversion of control

How to use Stored Procedure 
http://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/299/entity-framework-code-first-and-stored-procedures

C#
Use of Private Constructor - Stop Instantiation, Singleton, Factory Pattern
	Private constructor in the base class then how to inherit? Nested class can inherit?
	
Static Class  vs Class with Private Constructor and with all static members
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/79b3xss3.aspx

Why static can not be inherited.. because of Sealed by nature
    Static can be inherited from object class only
Static member can be overloaded but not overrided

Advantage of using constants
Because a constant’s value is embedded directly in code at compile time, constants don’t require any memory to be allocated for them at runtime

ReadyOnly vs Constants: Runtime constant and compile time constant, Const has performance gain. ReadyOnly is instance variable as compared to const which is a class level member. Const can not be passed as reference as its value is bind at compile time, but ReadyOnly can be.

Method extension - Purpose and example
	Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type. Extension methods are a special kind of static method, but they are called as if they were instance methods on the extended type.
	https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-IN/library/bb383977.aspx
	Binding of Extension Method at compile time
	Example:
	The most common extension methods are the LINQ standard query operators that add query functionality to the existing System.Collections.IEnumerable and System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T> types.
