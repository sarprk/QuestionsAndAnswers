Problem statement:
a.       Find available conference slots on a given day (use whole number for the hour). The conference table already has a list of scheduled conferences. Conferences do not overlap. Example: 20th-March-2017 is the day we want to find available conference slots
i.        The conference table has an entry from 20th March 12:00 am to 21st March 12 am. The result of this situation would be an empty set
ii.       The conference table has an entry/entries from 20th March 12 am to 20th March 10 pm. The result of this situation would be 2 entries
1.       20th March 10pm - 20th March 11pm
2.       20th March 11pm â€“ 21st March 12am
iii.      The conference table has an entry from 20th March 1 am to 21st March 12 am. The result of this situation would be 1 entry
1.       20th March 12am - 20th March 1am
